# Email Template Framework - Implementation Progress

## Step 1: Basic Component Structure ✅

We've successfully implemented the basic component structure for our email template framework:

1. **BaseComponent**: Foundation class with common functionality

   - Handling props and children
   - Generating HTML attributes and styles
   - Common rendering logic

2. **Row Component**: Horizontal layout container

   - Implemented using HTML tables for email compatibility
   - Support for alignment props (align, justify)
   - Support for gutter spacing between columns

3. **Column Component**: Vertical sections within rows

   - Support for responsive layouts with span, sm, md, lg props
   - 24-column grid system similar to Ant Design
   - Data attributes for responsive sizing

4. **Text Component**: Formatted text content

   - Support for styling (size, color, weight, align)
   - Consistent font handling for email clients

5. **Image Component**: Email-safe images

   - HTML attributes for better email client compatibility
   - Support for linking images to URLs
   - Alt text and size controls

6. **Email Component**: Root container

   - Complete HTML document structure
   - Email meta information (title, preview text)
   - Email-safe CSS resets
   - Conditional comments for Outlook compatibility

7. **Example Implementation**: Working welcome email example
   - Demonstrates component usage and nesting
   - Shows how to pass props and create layouts

## Step 2: Build a Simple Compiler ✅

We've successfully implemented a JSX compiler for our email template framework:

1. **JSX Transformer**

   - Transforms JSX syntax into component instantiation code
   - Handles ES modules (import/export)
   - Support for conditional rendering
   - Custom JSX factory function to instantiate our components

2. **Command-line Interface**

   - Build templates from JSX files
   - Preview templates with sample data
   - Render templates with custom data

3. **JSX Template Example**

   - Example welcome template using JSX syntax
   - Demonstrates conditional rendering
   - Shows responsive layout with different column widths

4. **Testing**
   - Support for testing JSX templates
   - File output for easier debugging

## Step 3: Set up Development Environment ✅

We've successfully implemented a development environment with hot reloading:

1. **Development Server**

   - Express-based server for serving templates
   - Browser-Sync for hot reloading
   - Template selection and previewing
   - Responsive design testing with device previews

2. **Email Client Compatibility Checking**

   - Checks templates for compatibility issues with popular email clients
   - Provides recommendations for fixing compatibility issues
   - Displays detailed information about email client support
   - Highlights potential problems in templates

3. **Additional Templates**

   - Added newsletter template example
   - Demonstrates more complex layouts
   - Shows array iteration and dynamic content

4. **Command-line Tools**

   - Development server with hot reloading
   - Easy-to-use scripts for common tasks
   - Support for real-time preview of changes

## Next Steps

### Step 4: Implement Responsive Design

- Add media query compilation
- Process responsive attributes into CSS
- Test responsiveness across email clients

### Step 5: Create Documentation

- Document component APIs
- Create usage examples
- Add best practices for email design

## Current Capabilities

The current implementation can:

1. Create email templates using component classes
2. Write templates using JSX syntax
3. Build and render templates to HTML
4. Support conditional rendering
5. Support basic responsive layouts
6. Preview templates with hot reloading
7. Check email client compatibility

## Testing

You can test the implementation using:

```
npm test         # Test the JavaScript API
npm run test:jsx # Test the JSX compiler
npm run dev      # Start the development server with hot reloading
```
