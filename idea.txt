I want to create a new framework to create email templates. So the new framework will be like more of react. I want to use minimal components like View Text and Images. Since you know we can not use flex and a lot css styles when building template. I want to use View components for that purpose. There are several props that I want in my view component. I also want to pass some props in my view component to make responsive styling. like sm md and lg props to render different ui in different screen sizes. I also want to write javascript in html just like in react to add conditional rendering. I don't want to utilize the hooks as they are needed in email templates. I want you to create a minimal framework from scratch. You can also use some other framework as reference. I don't know how to create framework so I am totally depend on you. Also this task is not like you read the prompt and start working and write code. I want this task to be more conversational. You ask me requirments and I give you suggestion. This task should be done in many steps as we are going to spend days to create a framework.

So the first thing do your research and let me know what I should provide you.
